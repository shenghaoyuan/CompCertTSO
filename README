Installation
============

Prerequisites: 

- Coq 8.3pl2 or 8.3pl1

- Ocaml 3.12.0 (Ocaml 3.11.* should work as well).

- gcc

  On x86-64 machines, an additional package (eg libc6-dev-i386) may
  be necessary for gcc to build 32-bit binaries.

- For a complete rebuild, including the Coq definition of ClightTSO,
  which is partly generated from Ott sources, you will also need the
  Ott tool, for which Version 0.20.3 is known to work.

In the distribution directory, run the following commands
(on Mac OS X replace "x86-linux" with "x86-macosx"):

./configure x86-linux
make depend
make all

This builds the compiler, interpreter and documentation.

Invoking the compiler
=====================

There are some example ClightTSO programs in test/c, including fib.c.
To compile and run fib.c from the distribution directory:

./ccomp -stdlib runtime -o fib test/c/fib.c
./fib

From any other directory, one should change the -stdlib runtime option
to point to the runtime directory of the distribution.

The full list of command line options can be obtained by

./ccomp -help


Invoking the interpreter
========================

The interpreter runs the ClightTSO semantics for a single-threaded
program, printing debug output.  To invoke it on a small example:

./clighti -v clighttest/test-intfn2.c 


Documentation
=============

Start from doc/index.html


Directory structure
===================

lib                - general libraries (integers mod 32, maps etc.)
common             - common definitions and theorems
                      * values, memory, simulations, TSO machine etc.
clightTSO          - semantics for ClightTSO
                      * written in Ott, Coq files are generated
cfrontend          - frontend parts of the compiler
                     (Csharpminor and Cstacked languages +
                      related compiler passes and proofs)
backend            - the backend passes of the compiler
                     (RTL - Machconcr definitions, semantics,
                      passes and proofs)
x86                - architecture-specific parts of the compiler
                      * x86 semantics
                      * plug-ins for machine-dependent parts
                        of several compiler passes
driver             - compiler wrapper that invokes individual passes
interpreter        - sources for the interpreter
extraction         - Coq -> Ocaml extraction script
doc                - documentation (start from doc/index.html)
test               - test C files from Leroy et al's CompCert
examples           - multi-threaded C examples
clighttest         - test of the semantics using the interpreter, 
                     tests invoked by 'sh clighttest/runtests.sh' 
                     (compares interpreter output to gcc)

cil                - CIL library used for parsing C; the 
                     directory is created by the configure script
                     (by unpacking cil.tar.gz)
